# Single-cell RNAseq Analysis Central Document

This will be my working document to connect all the datasets and different analysis pipelines together. 

## Projects

* [Dark genes in *Galaxea fasicularis*](https://github.com/kevinhwong1/DarkGenes_Bleaching_Comparison)
    * Are thermally responsive dark genes (unannotated differentially express genes) cell type specific? 
    * Can we use dark genes as cell markers in corals and other non-model organisms?
* [Functional characterization of immune cells in *Mnemiopsis leidyi*](https://github.com/kevinhwong1/Mnemi_Phagocyte)
    * Can we functionally characterize putative innate immune cells (phagocytes) in the marine invertebrate *Mnemiopsis leidyi*?

## Bioinformatic pipelines and troubleshooting

* Example of a general CellRanger workflow
    * Workflow is linked [here](https://github.com/kevinhwong1/KevinHWong_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2023-09-05-Gfas-Dark-Genes-Single-cell-preliminary-analysis.md)
* Comparing mitochondrial genome integration methods
    * Workflow and results are liked [here](https://github.com/kevinhwong1/KevinHWong_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2024-03-27-Testing-CellRanger-mitochondrial-genome-integration-approached-for-scRNAseq-data.md)
* "Barnyard" approach to map Symbiodinaceae and coral reads in CellRanger
    * Workflow is liked [here](https://github.com/kevinhwong1/KevinHWong_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2024-01-31-Gfas_Dtrenchii%20_CellRanger_Analysis.md)
